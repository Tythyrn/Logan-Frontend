  "deliverables": "- 4-6 Design Boards showing the design of the opening Title Card, the transition to footage, a couple of fullframe shots from the trailer, a transition frame, and the end card.\n- The end card must use the film’s logo (provided), and must feature “A Film by Mike Pecci” and the URL, 12kilometers.com",
  "descriptors": "- The film is a throwback to 1980’s horror movies like The Thing. It’s dark, creepy, and has an ominous tone throughout. The trailer GFX should reflect that.\n- 12KM was shot 2K with anamorphic lenses. Graphics should be designed for a 2048x768 format.\n- We loooooove the color-grade on the film, so don’t mess with colors (unless for a transition.)\n- We like Mike’s direction, but do something different. Similar, but different.",
