  "overview": "<p>IBM was working on a concept called “SmartCity” and we were asked to showcase some of the broader ideas encompassed by the project: Less traffic, affordable housing, lower energy costs. We received a script for a :30 spot and asked for the whole spot boarded out.</p><p>*created through School of Motion. For educational purposes only.</p>",
  "deliverables": "<ul><li>The entire spot must be boarded out and must go along with the script.</li><li>The spot should end with the SmartCity type featured along with the URL.</li></ul>",
  "descriptors": "<ul><li>12-24 frames</li><li>Needed to make this feel friendly. This technology could be seen as intrusive, so the challenge was to make the design help reinforce the idea that this is safe and to be used for good.</li><li>Brand guidelines provided for us to use and stick to.</li></ul>",
